I started my Bachelor in Socio-Economics at the Christian-Albrechts-University in Kiel in 2019. I gained basic knowledge in Economics, Political Science as well as Sociology. Besides the mandatory courses I chose optional classes like Climate Change Economics, Applied Econometrics and Risk and Entrepreneurship, gaining a deeper knowledge in these areas. I also took special courses in Business Spanish. My thesis was on the topic "Gender injustice and social protests in Chile - analysis of the role of women in the estallido social an their thematic focus" which was finally graded with a 1.3. My final grade for the Bachelor was 1.4, which I received in the summer 2023.

In October 2023 I started studying the double-degree masters programm International Political Economy at the Philipps-University Marburg. After two semesters in Marburg, I am currently studying at the University of Marburg, seeking to finalize my degree in May 2025.
